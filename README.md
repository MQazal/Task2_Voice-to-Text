# Task2_Voice-to-Text

In this task, I build user interface to convert the user's voice to text with the chance of save or no in this case it has error by these steps:
HTML: Create a simple web interface with a text area to display the converted text and save text buttom.
CSS: Style the web interface.
JavaScript: Use the Web Speech API to convert voice to text.
PHP: Create a backend script to save the text to a database.
Database: Set up a database in phpMyAdmin to store the text output.
